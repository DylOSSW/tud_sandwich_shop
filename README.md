## Homepage (index.html)

The `index.html` file serves as the homepage for TUD Sandwich Shop. Users can submit sandwich orders through a form. The form captures details such as customer name, choice of bread, filling, toppings, and condiments.

## Order Confirmation (process_order.php)

The `process_order.php` file handles form submissions from `index.html`. It retrieves user preferences, calculates the order total using PHP, and stores the details in a MariaDB database using an SQL statement.

## Styles (styles.css)

The `styles.css` file provides styling for HTML pages, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design.

### Technologies Used
- HTML: Used for structuring the webpage and capturing user input.
- CSS: Responsible for styling and ensuring a user-friendly interface.
- PHP: Powers the server-side logic for processing orders.
- MariaDB: A relational database management system storing order details.
- SQL: Utilized to create and manage the database schema.

### File Structure

### Database Setup
1. Create a MariaDB database named `TUD_Sandwich_Shop`.
2. Execute the SQL script in `database.sql` to set up necessary tables.
3. Use the following SQL statement to create the table and necessary fields:
   -- Table structure for the 'orders' table
   CREATE TABLE orders (
       id INTEGER UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(255),
       bread VARCHAR(50),
       filling VARCHAR(50),
       topping VARCHAR(50),
       condiment VARCHAR(50),
       price DECIMAL(5, 2)
   );

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Complete the sandwich order form.
3. Submit the form to place an order.

## Known Issues

- Orders with special characters may not be processed correctly.
- Users cannot select more than one topping/condiment (option to select more should be added).
- User cannot see how much the sandwich will cost until submit the form.
